- Extract makeGhosts
- Try to remove GameInterface
- Refactor store so that it doesnt get in the way
- Make scatter mode work
  - Warum geht der Ghost nicht von 1/7 nach 1/8?
  - Warum geht der Ghost nach -1/28 statt bei 1/1 stehen zu bleiben?
  - Warum geht die Anzeige kaputt?
  - Have different scatter goals per ghost
- Prevent ghost from going backwards, buy excluding the back direction in the wayfinding frontier
- Break up the CSS into many files
- Add tailwind to remove hacks
- useLocaleStore instead of useMemo
- Make the game display cleanly on a MacBook
- Have a backref from PacMan to Game to access timestamp
- Extract Game.pills into Maze store
- Fix the missing ways at 7/14 and 8/14
- Turn AnimationTestPage into a GamePage that plays the game
- Let the ghosts start in scatter mode
- Implement individual ghosts behaviours in scatter mode
- Ghosts general behaviour:
  - At each tile they choose a new target tile to go toward.
  - Then they inspect all neighbour tiles
  - A tile that is in opposite direction is removed.
  - Tiles in a wall are removed.
  - From the remaining moves, the distance to the target is calculated. The closest one is chosen as the next tile.
  - If there are multiple tiles with the same distance, the tiles are prioritized. Up is highest.
  - Then the new direction is chosen towards the new tile
- When the ghost reaches a position that would make it stand still, choose the first free direction that is not backward instead.
- Make ghost#wayPoints a @computed value - dependent on tileCoordinates and targetTile
- Fix chooseNextTile() / Found no candidate
- Support tunnel
- Show ghost targets
- Implement individual ghosts behaviours in hunt mode:
  - Blinky: PacMan
  - Pinky: The tile 4 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 4 tiles up and 4 tiles to the left.
  - Inky:
    o An intermediate tile is chosen. It is 2 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 2 tiles up and 2 tiles to the left.
    o Then the vector from the intermediate tile to Blinky is rotated 180 degrees. This is inkys target tile.
  - Clyde:
    o When >= 8 tiles away from pacMan: Target is PacMan.
    o When < 8 tiles away: Same tile as in scatter mode.
- After 7 seconds, go to hunt mode. After another 20 seconds, go to back to scatter mode
- Enable ghosts to through the tunnel
- findNextTile: Always use waypoints[1] as the next tile instead of searching through waypoints
- Let ghosts move slower in tunnel
- Remove ghost.timestamp
- When entering chase mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- When entering scatter mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- When pac man dies
   - let all ghosts pause
   - wait 5 seconds
   - When pac man has some live left
      - revive pac man
      - reset the ghosts
   - When pac man lost all lives
      - Hide the ghosts and pac man and show "Game Over"
- Separate SCREEN_TILE_SIZE and SPRITE_TILE_SIZE.
-  When I go to the bottom directly after start, the maze moves around on the screen. Probably because of the target sprite outside the maze.
  -  Debug approach:
    - in Game constructor, place pac man and ghosts at the bottom
    -  Add a pause key
  -  Idea to fix:
    -  Have a container for all sprites (= Board)
    -  Set it to overflow: none
-  Switch Ant to v4
-  Have ghost state view
- Ghosts that kills pac man enters scatter mode many times, over and over This is most visible in game over, when this happens forever.
- Frightened Mode:
  -  Detect collions with energizers
    -  Increase score
    -  Remove energizer
  - When Pac man eats an energizer
      -  Ghosts enter frightened state
      -  Pac Man enters chasing state
      -  the Frightened timer gets reset to 0
      -  game.killed ghost counter get reset to 0

    - on collision a ghost dies
      -  its state becomes "dead"
      -  dead ghost counter increments
      -  score increases 100, 200, 400, 800
      -  The ghost shows the "eyes" sprite
      -  No collision detection with a dead ghost
      -  Can I use a broken number as target for the ghost? To guide it back to the house? And out of the house? It would be 13.5/11

 Bug: After a ghost died, it ignores walls and just always moves in the same direction.
  -  The problem seems to be that the ghost never meets a tile center. This is problem a consequence of the frightened ghost moving at half speed.... A solution would be change speed only at a tile center.
 Bug: After a ghost died, the energizer timer gets reset to 0. That's not supposed to happen.
  - Dead ghosts:
    -  Go to the box
    -  Why can't they pass into the box anymore?
      -  Write a test
    -  Write timer: TimeoutTimer
-  Move Score to the top
-  Change extra live direction

-  Add GameDebugView with Restart Game
-  Move Revive PacMan to PacManDebugView

  -  in Pacmans chasing state
    - when the energizer timer exceeds the chasing time,
      -  Pac man goes back to eating mode
      -  Alive Ghosts go to scatter state
  - in frightened state Ghosts
    -  They show a frightened sprite
    -  They move slowly
    -  In each tile they choose a random direction that is not backward and not into a wall
    -  When late in the frightened phase, they show the "late frightened" sprite
    -  During the last 2 seconds of being frightened they show a white and blue blinking sprite
    -  Fix bug where ghost in tunnel doesnt follow its target tile. Seems to happen also when pacman hits one of the ghosts. With all ghosts.
-  Support notebook screen - make debug view smaller

-  Don't pause ghosts on pac mans death
-  Run Tests on git push
-  Margin on the Game Page
-  Score for killing ghosts
-  Add margin for app
-  Extract model directory
-  Move Page specific components to page directory
-  Bug: Switching between pages multiplies game speed
-  Clean up onTimeElapsed
-  Extract PacMan.moveBy
-  Remove setter actions from Store
-  Bug: Switching between pages doesn't reset the game
-  Hide debug panel if screen is not wide enough, because the game doesn't really work with the panel
below the maze.
-  UI based tests

- Viewport for mobile.
  Alternative: Always render at factor 1 and then apply a transform, based on current viewport width

- Touch based game play for mobile
